Apache Kafka

What is Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform which is used to handle the real-time data storage.
It works as a broker between two parties, i.e., a sender and a receiver.
It can handle about trillions of data events in a day.

What is a messaging system
A messaging system is a simple exchange of messages between two or more persons, devices, etc.
A publish-subscribe messaging system allows a sender to send/write the message and a receiver to read that message.
In Apache Kafka, a sender is known as a producer who publishes messages, and a receiver is known as a consumer who consumes that message by subscribing it.

What is Streaming process
A streaming process is the processing of data in parallelly connected systems.

This process allows different applications to limit the parallel execution of the data, where one record executes without waiting for the output of the previous record.

Therefore, a distributed streaming platform enables the user to simplify the task of the streaming process and parallel execution.

Therefore, a streaming platform in Kafka has the following key capabilities:

As soon as the streams of records occur, it processes it.
It works similar to an enterprise messaging system where it publishes and subscribes streams of records.
It stores the streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way. (A fault-tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails.)

Terminology
Topics
A stream of messages belonging to a particular category is called a topic. Data is stored in topics.
Partition
Topics may have many partitions, so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data. (Arbitrary data is any data in any format.)
Partition offset
Each partitioned message has a unique sequence id called as offset.
Replicas of partition
Replicas are nothing but backups of a partition. Replicas are never read or write data. They are used to prevent data loss.
Kafka Cluster
Kafka’s having more than one broker are called as Kafka cluster.
A Kafka cluster can be expanded without downtime.
These clusters are used to manage the persistence and replication of message data.
Brokers
Brokers are simple system responsible for maintaining the pub-lished data.
Each broker may have zero or more partitions per topic.
Kafka cluster typically consists of multiple brokers to maintain load balance.
Kafka brokers are stateless, so they use ZooKeeper for maintaining their cluster state.
One Kafka broker instance can handle hundreds of thousands of reads and writes per second and each bro-ker can handle TB of messages without performance impact.
ZooKeeper
ZooKeeper is used for managing and coordinating Kafka broker.
ZooKeeper service is mainly used to notify producer and consumer about the presence of any new broker in the Kafka system or failure of the broker in the Kafka system.
As per the notification received by the Zookeeper regarding presence or failure of the broker then pro-ducer and consumer takes decision and starts coordinating their task with some other broker.
Producers
Producers are the publisher of messages to one or more Kafka topics.
Producers send data to Kafka brokers. Every time a producer pub-lishes a message to a broker, the broker simply appends the message to the last segment file.
Consumers
Consumers read data from brokers.
Consumers subscribes to one or more topics and consume published messages by pulling data from the brokers.

Steps to implements Kafka
Download Kafka from : https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart

Before running application follow below steps

Go to C:\kafka_2.11-2.0.0\bin\windows folder using CMD and
You can name every CMD winodw "title name" command
Start ZooKeeper : zookeeper-server-start.bat C:_2.12-2.4.1\config\zookeeper.properties
Start Server : kafka-server-start.bat C:_2.12-2.4.1\config\server.properties
Create Topic : kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic helloTopic
Start Producer :kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic helloTopic
Now you can produce all messages either application or producer console
Start Consumer : kafka-console-consumer.bat --topic helloTopic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 to get all produced messages from the topic.
